# Technical Design Skill

## Overview

This skill guides you through a structured implementation planning workflow to create comprehensive technical design artifacts. It follows a phased approach from research through design to contract generation, ensuring all technical decisions are documented and aligned with project architecture.

## When to Use

- Planning implementation for new features or components
- Creating technical specifications and design documents
- Designing data models and API contracts
- Researching technical decisions and alternatives
- Aligning feature design with existing architecture
- Documenting implementation approaches
- When user requests "design this feature", "create technical plan", "plan implementation", or "design API"

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Feature specification or requirements document available
- Templates provided with this skill (in `templates/` directory)
- Scripts provided with this skill (in `scripts/` directory)

**Optional (workspace-level enhancements):**

- `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project constraints and standards
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architectural decisions and patterns
- Git repository (for branch tracking and commits)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Setup and Context Loading

1. **Run setup script** to create directory structure and copy templates:

   **Bash (macOS/Linux):**

   ```bash
   <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/setup-design.sh --json
   ```

   **PowerShell (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/setup-design.ps1 -Json
   ```

   Replace `<SKILL_DIR>` with the absolute path to this skill directory.

   The script will:
   - Create `design/` directory structure (or `specs/N-feature/design/` if on feature branch)
   - Copy all templates from skill's `templates/` directory
   - Return JSON with paths: `feature_design`, `research_file`, `data_model_file`, `contracts_dir`

2. **Load required context**:
   - Read feature specification/requirements (from JSON output: `feature_spec`)
   - Load `docs/ground-rules.md` if exists (optional - for project standards)
   - Load `docs/architecture.md` if exists (optional - for architectural patterns)
   - Identify current git branch from JSON output: `current_branch`

3. **Review design document template**:
   - Template already copied to path in JSON: `feature_design`
   - Review structure and sections
   - Begin filling in feature name and basic context

### Step 2: Technical Context Analysis

1. **Extract key information from requirements**:
   - Functional requirements (what the system must do)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - User interactions and workflows
   - Integration points with existing systems
   - Data requirements

2. **Document in design.md Technical Context section**:
   - List all known technical details
   - Mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION"
   - Reference ground-rules that apply
   - Note architectural patterns from architecture.md (if available)

3. **Evaluate against ground-rules**:
   - Check compliance with project standards
   - Document any conflicts or exceptions needed
   - Justify deviations if necessary

### Step 3: Phase 0 - Research & Resolution

**Goal**: Resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items before proceeding to design

1. **Identify research tasks from Technical Context**:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → create research question
   - For each technology choice → identify best practices needed
   - For each integration point → research integration patterns
   - Review architecture.md for relevant decisions and patterns

2. **Conduct research and document findings**:
   - Research template already copied by setup script (path in JSON: `research_file`)
   - Template structure provided in `templates/research-template.md`
   - For each decision, document:
     - **Decision**: What was chosen
     - **Rationale**: Why it was chosen
     - **Alternatives Considered**: What else was evaluated
     - **Architecture Alignment**: How it aligns with existing architecture (if applicable)
     - **Trade-offs**: Pros and cons
     - **References**: Sources consulted

3. **Update design.md with research outcomes**:
   - Replace all NEEDS CLARIFICATION with concrete decisions
   - Link to research.md for details

### Step 4: Phase 1 - Data Model Design

**Prerequisites**: All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved in Phase 0

1. **Extract entities from requirements**:
   - Identify domain objects and concepts
   - List attributes for each entity
   - Define relationships between entities
   - Identify state transitions (if applicable)

2. **Create data model document**:
   - Data model template already copied by setup script (path in JSON: `data_model_file`)
   - Template structure provided in `templates/data-model-template.md`
   - For each entity document:
     - Entity name and description
     - Fields with types and constraints
     - Validation rules
     - Relationships to other entities
     - State machine (if stateful)
   - Align with data models from architecture.md (if available in workspace)

3. **Add diagrams** (if helpful):
   - Entity-relationship diagrams
   - State transition diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams

### Step 5: Phase 1 - API Contract Generation

1. **Identify API endpoints from requirements**:
   - For each user action → determine endpoint
   - For each data query → determine read endpoint
   - For each data mutation → determine write endpoint

2. **Design API contracts**:
   - API contract template already copied by setup script (path in JSON: `contracts_dir`)
   - Template structure provided in `templates/api-contract-template.md`
   - Create additional contract files in contracts directory as needed
   - Follow REST or GraphQL patterns (per project standards)
   - Include:
     - Endpoint path/operation
     - HTTP method / GraphQL type
     - Request schema
     - Response schema
     - Error responses
     - Authentication requirements
   - Follow API design patterns from architecture.md (if available in workspace)

3. **Generate OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas**:
   - Create machine-readable contract files
   - Validate schema syntax
   - Add examples for each endpoint

### Step 6: Create Quickstart Guide

1. **Document implementation approach**:
   - Create quickstart file (path in JSON: `quickstart_file`)
   - Include:
     - High-level implementation steps
     - Technology stack for this feature
     - Key files/modules to create/modify
     - Integration points
     - Testing strategy
     - Deployment considerations

2. **Add code examples**:
   - Show key code patterns to use
   - Provide starter templates
   - Reference design decisions from research.md

### Step 7: Final Validation

1. **Review against ground-rules**:
   - Re-check all ground-rules compliance
   - Update Ground-rules Check section in design.md
   - Document any approved exceptions

2. **Verify completeness**:
   - All requirements addressed in design
   - All entities have data models
   - All user actions have API contracts
   - All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
   - Architecture alignment verified (if architecture.md exists)

3. **Create summary**:
   - Update design.md Executive Summary
   - List all generated artifacts
   - Document next steps (implementation)

### Step 8: Commit Design Artifacts

1. **Stage all design files**:

   ```bash
   git add design/design.md
   git add design/research/research.md
   git add design/data-model.md
   git add design/contracts/
   git add design/quickstart.md
   ```

2. **Create commit with 'docs:' prefix**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: add implementation plan for [feature-name]"
   ```

3. **Report completion**:
   - List all generated artifacts with paths
   - Confirm commit completed
   - Note current branch
   - Suggest next steps (task breakdown, checklist creation, E2E test design)

## Examples

### Example 1: User Authentication Feature

**Input**:

```
Design user authentication with email/password and OAuth support
```

**Process**:

1. Create design/design.md from template
2. Technical Context identifies: auth provider choice, token strategy, session management
3. Research.md documents: JWT vs sessions (chose JWT), OAuth provider comparison (chose Auth0)
4. data-model.md defines: User entity, AuthToken entity, relationships
5. contracts/ includes: POST /auth/login, POST /auth/register, GET /auth/me, POST /auth/oauth/callback
6. quickstart.md outlines: auth middleware setup, token validation, refresh flow

**Output**: Complete design package in design/ directory, committed to git

### Example 2: Payment Processing Integration

**Input**:

```
Add Stripe payment processing to checkout flow
```

**Process**:

1. Load ground-rules.md for security requirements
2. Technical Context: Stripe API version, webhook handling, idempotency
3. Research: Stripe best practices, payment flow patterns, security considerations
4. Data model: Payment, PaymentIntent, PaymentMethod entities
5. Contracts: POST /payments/create-intent, POST /payments/confirm, POST /webhooks/stripe
6. Quickstart: Stripe SDK setup, webhook verification, error handling patterns

**Output**: Payment integration design, aligned with security ground-rules, ready for implementation

## Edge Cases

### No architecture.md Available

- **Case**: Project doesn't have architecture documentation
- **Handling**: Skip architecture alignment steps, document design decisions directly in research.md

### Conflicting Ground Rules

- **Case**: Feature requirements conflict with established ground-rules
- **Handling**: Document conflict in design.md, propose exception with justification, escalate to team lead

### Incomplete Requirements

- **Case**: Feature spec lacks critical details
- **Handling**: Add to NEEDS CLARIFICATION, create research tasks to fill gaps, document assumptions

### External API Dependencies

- **Case**: Feature depends on third-party API
- **Handling**: Research API thoroughly, document API version and capabilities in research.md, include fallback strategies

### Complex State Machines

- **Case**: Entity has many states and transitions
- **Handling**: Create detailed state diagram in data-model.md, document all valid transitions, include error states

## Error Handling

### Research Findings Incomplete

- **Error**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain after research phase
- **Action**: Return to research phase, conduct deeper investigation, consult team if needed

### Ground Rules Violation

- **Error**: Design conflicts with mandatory ground-rules
- **Action**: Stop design process, document conflict, revise design to comply or get exception approval

### Missing Prerequisites

- **Error**: Required context files (feature spec, ground-rules.md) not found
- **Action**: Report missing files, request user to provide or create them first

### Invalid API Contract

- **Error**: Generated OpenAPI/GraphQL schema has validation errors
- **Action**: Review contract structure, fix schema syntax, validate again

### Incomplete Data Model

- **Error**: Entities missing relationships or validation rules
- **Action**: Review requirements again, add missing details, ensure all entity interactions documented

## Guidelines

1. **Always use absolute paths** when referencing files
2. **ERROR and stop** if ground-rules violations cannot be justified
3. **Document all decisions** with rationale in research.md
4. **Align with architecture** when architecture.md exists
5. **Generate complete contracts** - don't leave TODOs in API specifications
6. **Validate schemas** before committing
7. **Use templates provided** in templates/ directory for consistency
8. **Commit with 'docs:' prefix** for design documentation
9. **Mark unknowns clearly** with "NEEDS CLARIFICATION" during initial analysis
10. **Resolve all clarifications** before moving to design phase

## Included Resources

This skill is self-contained and includes:

**Templates** (in `templates/` directory):

- `design-template.md` - Main implementation plan structure
- `research-template.md` - Research findings and decisions format
- `data-model-template.md` - Entity and data model documentation
- `api-contract-template.md` - API endpoint specification format

**Scripts** (in `scripts/` directory):

- `setup-design.sh` - Bash script for directory setup (macOS/Linux)
- `setup-design.ps1` - PowerShell script for directory setup (Windows)

**Optional Workspace Files** (if available in project):

- `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project constraints and standards
- `docs/architecture.md` - Architectural decisions and patterns

All templates are automatically copied by the setup script to the appropriate design directory.

## Next Steps After Design

After completing the technical design, consider these follow-up actions:

1. **Task Breakdown**: Use phoenix.taskify agent to break design into implementation tasks
2. **Checklist Creation**: Use phoenix.checklist agent to create validation checklist
3. **E2E Test Design**: Use phoenix.design-e2e-test agent to design end-to-end tests
4. **Implementation**: Begin implementing according to quickstart.md and data models
