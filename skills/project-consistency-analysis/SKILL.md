# Project Consistency Analysis Skill

## Overview

This skill performs comprehensive, non-destructive consistency and quality analysis across project specification artifacts (spec.md, design.md, tasks.md). It identifies duplications, ambiguities, underspecifications, ground-rules violations, coverage gaps, and inconsistencies before implementation begins. The analysis is strictly read-only and produces structured reports with actionable recommendations.

## When to Use

- After completing task breakdown (tasks.md generated)
- Before starting implementation
- Validating project artifact consistency
- Checking ground-rules compliance
- Identifying requirements coverage gaps
- Detecting ambiguous or duplicate requirements
- User mentions: "analyze project", "check consistency", "validate artifacts", "quality analysis", "check spec"

## Prerequisites

- **Required documents in feature directory**:
  - `spec.md` - Feature requirements and user stories (Required)
  - `design.md` - Technical design and architecture (Required)
  - `tasks.md` - Implementation task breakdown (Required)
- **Ground rules document** (Highly recommended):
  - `docs/ground-rules.md` - Project principles and guidelines
- **Product-level documentation** (Optional):
  - `docs/architecture.md` - Architectural patterns and decisions
  - `docs/standards.md` - Coding and design standards
- **Tools**: bash (Unix/Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) for running prerequisite checks

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites and Load Artifacts

Run the prerequisite check script to verify required documents exist:

**Bash (Unix/Linux/macOS):**

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
bash skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.sh --json
```

**PowerShell (Windows):**

```powershell
cd C:\path\to\repo
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.ps1 -Json
```

Parse the output to extract:

- `FEATURE_DIR`: Absolute path to feature directory
- `SPEC_FILE`: Path to spec.md
- `DESIGN_FILE`: Path to design.md
- `TASKS_FILE`: Path to tasks.md
- `GROUND_RULES_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if ground-rules.md exists
- `ARCHITECTURE_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if architecture.md exists
- `STANDARDS_AVAILABLE`: Boolean indicating if standards.md exists

### Step 2: Load Artifacts with Progressive Disclosure

Load only minimal necessary context from each artifact to maintain token efficiency:

#### From spec.md (Required)

- **Overview/Context**: Project purpose and scope
- **Functional Requirements**: What the system must do
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability, etc.
- **User Stories**: User actions with acceptance criteria
- **Edge Cases**: Unusual scenarios and handling (if present)

#### From design.md (Required)

- **Architecture/Stack Choices**: Technology decisions
- **Data Model References**: Entity definitions
- **Phases**: Development phases or milestones
- **Technical Constraints**: Limitations and dependencies

#### From tasks.md (Required)

- **Task IDs**: Unique identifiers (T001, T002, etc.)
- **Task Descriptions**: What each task accomplishes
- **Phase Grouping**: Which phase each task belongs to
- **Parallel Markers**: [P] indicators for parallel execution
- **Referenced File Paths**: Files to create/modify

#### From docs/ground-rules.md (If Available)

- **Principle Names**: Core project principles
- **MUST/SHOULD Statements**: Normative requirements
- **Quality Gates**: Required checkpoints
- **Prohibited Practices**: What to avoid

#### From docs/architecture.md (If Available)

- **Architectural Patterns**: Design patterns to follow
- **Technology Stack**: Approved technologies
- **Component Organization**: System structure
- **Quality Attribute Requirements**: Performance, security goals
- **ADRs**: Architecture Decision Records

#### From docs/standards.md (If Available)

- **UI Naming Conventions**: Component, prop, event names
- **Code Naming Conventions**: Variables, functions, classes
- **File Structure Standards**: Directory organization
- **API Design Standards**: Endpoint conventions

### Step 3: Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations for analysis (do not include in output):

#### Requirements Inventory

- Extract each functional and non-functional requirement
- Generate stable keys using slug format (e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- Track requirement location (file, line number)

#### User Story/Action Inventory

- Extract discrete user actions
- Map acceptance criteria to each story
- Identify story dependencies

#### Task Coverage Mapping

- Map each task to one or more requirements or stories
- Use keyword matching and explicit references (IDs, key phrases)
- Track unmapped tasks and uncovered requirements

#### Ground-Rules Rule Set

- Extract principle names
- Identify MUST and SHOULD normative statements
- Create validation criteria

### Step 4: Detection Passes (High-Signal Analysis)

Focus on actionable findings. Limit to 50 findings total; summarize overflow.

#### A. Duplication Detection

**Objective:** Identify near-duplicate requirements that should be consolidated

**Detection Criteria:**

- Requirements with >70% textual similarity
- Same user story described multiple times
- Repeated non-functional requirements with different wording

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** spec.md:L45, spec.md:L120
- **Issue:** Two requirements both specify "fast response time" without clear distinction
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate into single requirement with measurable criteria

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

**Objective:** Flag vague or unmeasurable requirements

**Detection Criteria:**

- Vague adjectives without measurable criteria:
  - "fast", "scalable", "secure", "intuitive", "robust", "efficient", "user-friendly"
- Unresolved placeholders:
  - "TODO", "TKTK", "???", "<placeholder>", "[to be determined]"
- Requirements using "should" without clear definition
- Acceptance criteria with subjective measures

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** spec.md:L78
- **Issue:** "System must be fast" - no measurable performance criteria
- **Recommendation:** Specify concrete metric (e.g., "API responses < 200ms for 95th percentile")

#### C. Underspecification Detection

**Objective:** Identify incomplete or unclear requirements

**Detection Criteria:**

- Requirements with action verbs but missing objects or outcomes
- User stories missing acceptance criteria
- Tasks referencing undefined files or components
- Non-functional requirements without implementation guidance

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** spec.md:L92
- **Issue:** "System must handle errors" - missing error types and handling strategies
- **Recommendation:** Specify error types, logging requirements, and user feedback mechanisms

#### D. Ground-Rules Alignment

**Objective:** Validate compliance with project principles

**Detection Criteria:**

- Any requirement or design element conflicting with MUST principles
- Missing mandated sections from ground-rules
- Skipped quality gates
- Use of prohibited practices

**Severity:** All ground-rules violations are CRITICAL

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** design.md:L150
- **Issue:** Violates ground-rule "MUST use TypeScript for type safety" - design specifies plain JavaScript
- **Recommendation:** Update design to use TypeScript or update ground-rules if principle changed

#### E. Coverage Gap Detection

**Objective:** Ensure all requirements have corresponding tasks

**Detection Criteria:**

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement or user story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in implementation tasks
- Missing tasks for security, performance, or accessibility requirements

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** spec.md:L56 (Requirement: data-encryption)
- **Issue:** No tasks implement data encryption requirement
- **Recommendation:** Add tasks for encryption implementation and testing

#### F. Inconsistency Detection

**Objective:** Identify contradictions and misalignments

**Detection Criteria:**

- **Terminology Drift**: Same concept named differently (e.g., "User" vs "Account" vs "Profile")
- **Data Entity Mismatches**: Entities in design.md not defined in spec.md (or vice versa)
- **Task Ordering Issues**: Integration tasks before foundational setup without dependency notes
- **Conflicting Requirements**: Contradictory technology or approach specifications
- **Architecture Misalignment**: Design uses technology not approved in architecture.md
- **Standards Violations**: File/code naming not following standards.md
- **Pattern Deviations**: Implementation not following architectural patterns

**Example Finding:**

- **Location:** spec.md:L34 vs design.md:L78
- **Issue:** Spec requires Next.js, design specifies Vue.js
- **Recommendation:** Resolve technology conflict - align spec and design

### Step 5: Severity Assignment

Assign severity levels to prioritize findings:

#### CRITICAL

- Violates ground-rules MUST requirement
- Missing core spec artifact
- Requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- Contradictory requirements preventing implementation
- Major security or data integrity gaps

**Action:** Must resolve before implementation

#### HIGH

- Duplicate or conflicting requirements
- Ambiguous security/performance attributes
- Untestable acceptance criteria
- Missing non-functional requirement coverage
- Architecture/standards violations

**Action:** Should resolve before implementation

#### MEDIUM

- Terminology drift affecting clarity
- Underspecified edge cases
- Minor coverage gaps in optional features
- Task ordering inconsistencies with workarounds

**Action:** Can proceed but recommend fixes

#### LOW

- Style/wording improvements
- Minor redundancy not affecting execution
- Optional documentation gaps
- Cosmetic inconsistencies

**Action:** Optional improvements, can defer

### Step 6: Generate Analysis Report

Create structured report using `templates/analysis-report.md`:

**Report Structure:**

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Overall status (Pass / Issues Found / Critical Issues)
   - Total findings by severity
   - Coverage percentage
   - Key metrics

2. **Findings Table**

   | ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | A1 | Ambiguity | HIGH | spec.md:L78 | "Fast response" unmeasurable | Define < 200ms target |
   | D1 | Duplication | MEDIUM | spec.md:L45, L120 | Duplicate requirements | Merge into single req |

3. **Coverage Summary**

   | Requirement Key | Has Tasks? | Task IDs | Notes |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | user-can-login | ✅ | T010, T011 | Complete |
   | data-encryption | ❌ | - | Missing implementation |

4. **Ground-Rules Alignment Issues** (if any)

   List all CRITICAL ground-rules violations with recommendations

5. **Unmapped Tasks** (if any)

   Tasks that don't map to any requirement or user story

6. **Metrics Summary**
   - Total Requirements: X
   - Total Tasks: Y
   - Coverage %: Z% (requirements with ≥1 task)
   - Findings: Critical: A, High: B, Medium: C, Low: D
   - Ambiguity Count: E
   - Duplication Count: F

### Step 7: Provide Next Actions

Based on analysis results, recommend next steps:

#### If CRITICAL Issues Exist

- **Stop:** Do not proceed with implementation
- **Action:** Resolve critical issues first
- **Commands:** Suggest specific commands to fix issues
  - `/phoenix.specify` - Refine specifications
  - `/phoenix.design` - Adjust architecture
  - Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage

#### If Only HIGH/MEDIUM Issues

- **Proceed with Caution:** Can start implementation but should fix issues
- **Action:** Address high-priority items, defer medium if needed
- **Commands:** Provide improvement suggestions

#### If Only LOW Issues or No Issues

- **Clear to Proceed:** Ready for implementation
- **Action:** Optional improvements can be deferred
- **Commands:** `/phoenix.implement` to start implementation

**Example Next Actions Block:**

```markdown
## Next Actions

**Status:** 🔴 Critical Issues Found - Do Not Implement

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Resolve Technology Conflict** (CRITICAL)
   - Location: spec.md:L34 vs design.md:L78
   - Action: Align on Next.js or Vue.js, update conflicting document

2. **Add Encryption Tasks** (CRITICAL)
   - Location: spec.md:L56
   - Action: Add tasks to tasks.md for data encryption implementation

3. **Fix Ground-Rules Violation** (CRITICAL)
   - Location: design.md:L150
   - Action: Update design to use TypeScript per ground-rules

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Run `/phoenix.specify` to refine ambiguous requirements
2. Edit tasks.md to add coverage for missing requirements
3. Re-run analysis after fixes to verify resolution
```

### Step 8: Offer Remediation Suggestions

After presenting the report, ask the user:

**"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?"**

**Important:** Do NOT apply edits automatically. This skill is strictly read-only.

If user agrees, provide specific edit recommendations:

- Exact file paths and line numbers
- "Change from" → "Change to" examples
- Rationale for each change

## Operating Principles

### Strictly Read-Only

- **NEVER** modify any files during analysis
- **NEVER** auto-apply fixes or remediation
- **ALWAYS** output findings to console or report file only

### Token Efficiency

- **Minimal High-Signal Tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally, don't dump all content
- **Limited Output**: Cap findings at 50 rows, summarize overflow
- **Deterministic Results**: Rerunning without changes produces consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Quality

- **No Hallucination**: If sections are missing, report accurately - don't invent content
- **Prioritize Ground-Rules**: Violations are automatically CRITICAL
- **Concrete Examples**: Cite specific instances, not generic patterns
- **Graceful Zero-Issues**: Emit success report with coverage statistics if no issues found

### Ground-Rules Authority

Ground rules from `docs/ground-rules.md` are **non-negotiable**:

- MUST principles cannot be overridden or reinterpreted
- Ground-rules conflicts are automatically CRITICAL
- Changing principles requires explicit ground-rules update (separate process)
- Do not dilute or ignore principles in analysis

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Analysis with Issues

**Input:**

```bash
bash skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.sh --json
```

**Output:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "feature_dir": "/path/to/specs/feature-name",
  "spec_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/spec.md",
  "design_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/design.md",
  "tasks_file": "/path/to/specs/feature-name/tasks.md",
  "ground_rules_available": true,
  "architecture_available": true,
  "standards_available": true
}
```

**Analysis Results:**

- 3 Critical issues (1 ground-rules violation, 2 missing coverage)
- 5 High issues (ambiguous requirements)
- 8 Medium issues (terminology drift)
- 2 Low issues (style improvements)
- Coverage: 85% (45/53 requirements have tasks)

**Recommendation:** Resolve critical issues before implementation

### Example 2: Clean Analysis (No Issues)

**Analysis Results:**

- 0 Critical issues
- 0 High issues
- 2 Medium issues (minor terminology inconsistencies)
- 1 Low issue (optional documentation)
- Coverage: 100% (all requirements have tasks)

**Recommendation:** Ready to proceed with implementation

## Edge Cases

- **Missing tasks.md**: Report error, suggest running task generation first
- **Malformed YAML frontmatter**: Attempt to parse, report parsing errors
- **Empty artifacts**: Report as critical underspecification
- **No ground-rules.md**: Skip ground-rules validation, note absence in report
- **Architecture/standards.md missing**: Skip those validation passes
- **Circular references**: Detect and report as inconsistency
- **Very large artifacts**: Use sampling or focus on high-priority sections

## Error Handling

- **Script execution fails**: Report exact error, check working directory
- **Invalid JSON from script**: Parse as text and extract paths manually
- **Missing required documents**: List what's missing, provide commands to create
- **Cannot read artifacts**: Report access issues, suggest checking permissions
- **Analysis timeout**: Report partial results, suggest breaking down analysis
- **Memory constraints**: Use streaming analysis for large artifacts

## Scripts

This skill includes cross-platform scripts for checking analysis prerequisites:

### Bash Script (Unix/Linux/macOS)

```bash
bash skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.sh --json
```

**Features:**

- Locates feature directory and required artifacts
- Verifies spec.md, design.md, tasks.md exist
- Checks for ground-rules.md, architecture.md, standards.md
- JSON and human-readable output

### PowerShell Script (Windows)

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File skills/project-consistency-analysis/scripts/check-analysis-prerequisites.ps1 -Json
```

**Features:**

- Locates feature directory and required artifacts
- Verifies spec.md, design.md, tasks.md exist
- Checks for ground-rules.md, architecture.md, standards.md
- JSON and human-readable output

### Script Output Format

Both scripts output JSON with:

- `success`: Boolean indicating if prerequisites met
- `feature_dir`: Path to feature directory
- `spec_file`: Path to spec.md
- `design_file`: Path to design.md
- `tasks_file`: Path to tasks.md
- `ground_rules_available`: Boolean for ground-rules.md
- `architecture_available`: Boolean for architecture.md
- `standards_available`: Boolean for standards.md
- `error`: Error message if prerequisites not met

## Templates

- `templates/analysis-report.md`: Structure for comprehensive consistency analysis reports

## Guidelines

1. **Be Thorough But Focused**: Analyze systematically, prioritize high-impact findings
2. **Be Objective**: Report facts, not opinions
3. **Be Specific**: Reference exact locations (file:line)
4. **Prioritize Severity**: Use severity levels consistently
5. **Explain Rationale**: Why something is an issue, not just what
6. **Suggest Solutions**: Provide actionable recommendations
7. **Respect Context**: Understand project constraints
8. **Never Modify Files**: Strictly read-only analysis
9. **Use Examples**: Show concrete instances, not abstractions
10. **Report Gracefully**: Handle zero-issues case positively

## Success Criteria
