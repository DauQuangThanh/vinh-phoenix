## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

- [ ] [Action 1 - if any Outstanding high-priority items remain]
- [ ] [Action 2]

### Deferred Items

Items deferred to planning/design phase:

- [Item 1 - with rationale for deferral]
- [Item 2]

### Next Steps

**If all critical items resolved**:

- ✅ Spec is ready for technical design
- Suggested next command: `/phoenix.design` or use technical-design skill

**If Outstanding items remain**:

- ⚠️ Run another review session to address: [list categories]
- Focus areas: [specific high-priority gaps]

**If quota reached with gaps**:

- ⚠️ Question limit reached (5 of 5 asked)
- Consider: Running another session to cover [list remaining categories]
- Risk: Proceeding now may cause downstream rework

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk - Proceed to Design

- All critical categories Clear or Resolved
- No high-impact Outstanding items
- Testable acceptance criteria present
- Non-functional requirements measurable

### Medium Risk - Consider Another Review

- Some high-impact items Deferred or Outstanding
- Key non-functional requirements still vague
- Data model partially specified
- May cause minor rework during design

### High Risk - Another Review Required

- Critical functional requirements unclear
- Multiple high-impact categories Outstanding
- Security/compliance requirements undefined
- Will likely cause significant rework if proceeding now

**Current Risk Level**: [Low / Medium / High]

**Rationale**: [Explain risk assessment]
