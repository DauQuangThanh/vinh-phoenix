# Requirements Specification Review

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Reviewing an existing feature specification for completeness
- Identifying ambiguous or underspecified requirements
- Clarifying unclear aspects of a spec before implementation planning
- Validating that a spec is ready for design/development
- Finding gaps in functional or non-functional requirements
- User mentions: spec review, clarification, requirements validation, gap analysis, ambiguity detection

## Prerequisites

**Required:**

- Existing feature specification file
- Scripts provided with this skill (in `scripts/` directory)
- Templates provided with this skill (in `templates/` directory)

**Optional (workspace-level enhancements):**

- `docs/architecture.md` - For architecture alignment validation
- `docs/standards.md` - For standards compliance checking
- Git repository (for tracking and commits)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Setup and Load Specification

1. **Run prerequisites check script** to locate the feature specification:

   **Bash (macOS/Linux):**

   ```bash
   <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only
   ```

   **PowerShell (Windows):**

   ```powershell
   <SKILL_DIR>/scripts/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly
   ```

   Replace `<SKILL_DIR>` with the absolute path to this skill directory.

   The script returns JSON with:
   - `FEATURE_DIR` - Feature directory path
   - `FEATURE_SPEC` - Path to spec.md file
   - `CURRENT_BRANCH` - Git branch name (if available)

2. **Load the specification file**:
   - Read the spec file from `FEATURE_SPEC` path
   - Parse its structure and sections
   - Identify existing content and placeholders

3. **Load optional context** (if available):
   - `docs/architecture.md` - For architecture alignment checks
   - `docs/standards.md` - For standards compliance checks

### Step 2: Perform Structured Coverage Scan

Scan the specification using this comprehensive taxonomy. For each category, assess status: **Clear** / **Partial** / **Missing**.

#### Taxonomy Categories

**1. Functional Scope & Behavior**

- Core user goals & success criteria defined
- Explicit out-of-scope declarations present
- User roles / personas differentiation clear

**2. Domain & Data Model**

- Entities, attributes, relationships documented
- Identity & uniqueness rules specified
- Lifecycle/state transitions defined
- Data volume / scale assumptions stated

**3. Interaction & UX Flow**

- Critical user journeys / sequences documented
- Error/empty/loading states specified
- Accessibility or localization notes included

**4. Non-Functional Quality Attributes**

- Performance targets (latency, throughput) specified
- Scalability expectations (horizontal/vertical, limits) defined
- Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery) stated
- Observability needs (logging, metrics, tracing) documented
- Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection) specified
- Compliance / regulatory constraints noted

**5. Integration & External Dependencies**

- External services/APIs and failure modes documented
- Data import/export formats specified
- Protocol/versioning assumptions stated

**6. Edge Cases & Failure Handling**

- Negative scenarios documented
- Rate limiting / throttling behavior specified
- Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits) defined

**7. Constraints & Tradeoffs**

- Technical constraints documented
- Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives noted

**8. Architecture Alignment** (if architecture.md exists)

- Alignment with architectural patterns validated
- Consistency with technology stack verified
- Adherence to quality attribute requirements checked

**9. Standards Compliance** (if standards.md exists)

- Naming convention requirements checked
- File structure alignment verified
- Coding standard adherence validated

**10. Terminology & Consistency**

- Canonical glossary terms used consistently
- No conflicting synonyms / deprecated terms

**11. Completion Signals**

- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Measurable Definition of Done indicators present

**12. Placeholders & Ambiguities**

- No TODO markers remain
- Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") are quantified

**Create internal coverage map** (do not output unless no questions will be asked):

- List each category with its status
- Note specific gaps or ambiguities found
- Calculate priority score: Impact × Uncertainty

### Step 3: Generate Prioritized Question Queue

Based on the coverage scan, generate an internal prioritized queue of clarification questions:

**Constraints:**

- **Maximum 5 questions** per review session
- **Maximum 10 questions** across all sessions for this spec
- Each question must be answerable with:
  - Multiple-choice (2-5 options), OR
  - Short phrase answer (≤5 words)

**Prioritization Criteria:**

1. **Impact**: Will the answer materially change architecture, data modeling, testing, or UX?
2. **Uncertainty**: Is this highly ambiguous or missing?
3. **Risk**: Will lack of clarity cause downstream rework?
4. **Coverage balance**: Spread questions across high-impact categories

**Exclusion Rules:**

- Skip if already answered in spec
- Skip if trivial stylistic preference
- Skip if better deferred to planning phase
- Skip if doesn't block correctness

**Selection Strategy:**

- If >5 categories unresolved, select top 5 by (Impact × Uncertainty)
- Favor questions that reduce rework risk
- Ensure category diversity

### Step 4: Interactive Questioning Loop

Present questions one at a time in an interactive loop:

#### For Each Question

1. **Analyze and recommend** (for multiple-choice questions):
   - Determine the most suitable option based on:
     - Best practices for the project type
     - Common patterns in similar implementations
     - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
     - Alignment with project goals/constraints
   - Present recommendation prominently at the top

2. **Format the question**:

   **Multiple-choice format:**

   ```markdown
   ## Question N: [Topic]

   **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section or describe gap]

   **Recommended:** Option [X] - [Brief reasoning why this is best]

   | Option | Description |
   |--------|-------------|
   | A | [Option A description] |
   | B | [Option B description] |
   | C | [Option C description] |
   | Short | Provide a different short answer (≤5 words) |

   You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.
   ```

   **Short-answer format:**

   ```markdown
   ## Question N: [Topic]

   **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section or describe gap]

   **Suggested:** [Your proposed answer] - [Brief reasoning]

   Format: Short answer (≤5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.
   ```

3. **Wait for user response**

4. **Process the answer**:
   - If user says "yes", "recommended", or "suggested": Use your recommendation/suggestion
   - If user provides option letter or short answer: Validate it
   - If ambiguous: Ask for quick disambiguation (doesn't count as new question)
   - Record answer in working memory

5. **Move to next question** until:
   - All critical ambiguities resolved, OR
   - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
   - 5 questions asked

**Special Cases:**

- If no valid questions exist: Report "No critical ambiguities detected" and suggest proceeding
- If spec file missing: Instruct user to create spec first
- Respect early termination: Stop when user says "stop" or "done"

### Step 5: Integrate Each Answer (Incremental Updates)

After EACH accepted answer, immediately update the spec:

1. **Ensure Clarifications section exists**:
   - Add `## Clarifications` section if not present (after overview/context section)
   - Create `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today

2. **Record the Q&A**:
   - Append: `- Q: [question] → A: [final answer]`

3. **Apply clarification to appropriate section(s)**:

   | Answer Type | Target Section | Action |
   |-------------|----------------|--------|
   | Functional requirement | Functional Requirements | Add/update requirement bullet |
   | User interaction/actor | User Scenarios or Actors | Update role, constraint, or scenario |
   | Data model | Key Entities or Data Model | Add fields, types, relationships |
   | Non-functional | Non-Functional / Quality Attributes | Add measurable criteria |
   | Edge case | Edge Cases / Error Handling | Add new bullet or subsection |
   | Terminology | Throughout spec | Normalize term, note old usage once |

4. **Replace, don't duplicate**:
   - If answer invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace it
   - Remove obsolete contradictory text
   - Keep each clarification minimal and testable

5. **Save the spec file** after each integration (atomic write)

6. **Preserve formatting**:
   - Don't reorder unrelated sections
   - Keep heading hierarchy intact
   - Maintain consistent style

### Step 6: Validation

After EACH write and at final completion, validate:

**Per-Integration Checks:**

- [ ] Clarifications session has exactly one bullet per answer (no duplicates)
- [ ] Updated section contains no lingering vague placeholders
- [ ] No contradictory earlier statement remains
- [ ] Markdown structure is valid
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across updated sections

**Final Validation:**

- [ ] Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5
- [ ] Only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`
- [ ] All integrated answers are reflected in appropriate sections
- [ ] Spec is internally consistent

### Step 7: Commit Changes

After all questions are answered and integrated:

1. **Stage the updated spec**:

   ```bash
   git add <FEATURE_SPEC>
   ```

2. **Create commit with 'docs:' prefix**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: clarify requirements for <feature-name>"
   ```

3. Include summary of what was clarified in commit message if helpful

### Step 8: Report Completion

Provide a completion report with:

1. **Summary statistics**:
   - Number of questions asked & answered
   - Path to updated spec file
   - Sections touched (list names)

2. **Coverage summary table**:

   | Category | Status | Notes |
   |----------|--------|-------|
   | Functional Scope | Resolved | Was Partial, now Clear |
   | Data Model | Clear | Already sufficient |
   | Non-Functional | Deferred | Low impact, defer to planning |
   | Edge Cases | Outstanding | Still Partial, needs follow-up |
   | ... | ... | ... |

3. **Status legend**:
   - **Resolved**: Was Partial/Missing, now addressed
   - **Clear**: Already sufficient from start
   - **Deferred**: Exceeds question quota or better suited for planning phase
   - **Outstanding**: Still Partial/Missing but low impact

4. **Recommendations**:
   - If Outstanding or Deferred items remain: Suggest whether to proceed or run review again
   - Suggest next command: `/phoenix.design`, `/phoenix.architect`, or another review

5. **Next steps**: Guide user on what to do next based on spec completeness

## Examples

### Example 1: Data Model Clarification

**Input**: Review spec for user authentication feature

**Coverage Scan Findings**:

- Functional Scope: Clear
- Data Model: Partial (missing password storage details)
- Security: Partial (no password policy specified)
- Edge Cases: Missing (no account lockout policy)

**Questions Asked**:

```markdown
## Question 1: Password Storage

**Context**: Spec mentions "store user passwords" but doesn't specify hashing method.

**Recommended:** Option B - Industry standard with excellent security track record

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| A | bcrypt with cost factor 10 |
| B | bcrypt with cost factor 12 (recommended) |
| C | argon2id with default parameters |
```

**User Answer**: "B"

**Integration**:

- Clarifications section: `- Q: Password storage method? → A: bcrypt with cost factor 12`
- Security section: Added "Passwords hashed using bcrypt (cost factor 12)"
- Data Model: Updated User entity to note "password_hash: string (bcrypt)"

**Output**: Spec updated, 1 question asked, 4 sections touched, ready for next questions

### Example 2: Performance Requirements

**Input**: Review spec for analytics dashboard

**Coverage Scan**: Non-functional requirements partially specified

**Question**:

```markdown
## Question 1: Query Performance

**Context**: Spec says "dashboard should load quickly" but lacks measurable target.

**Suggested:** Initial load under 2 seconds - Standard for good UX

Format: Short answer (≤5 words). Accept suggestion or provide alternative.
```

**User Answer**: "yes"

**Integration**:

- Clarifications: `- Q: Dashboard load time target? → A: Initial load under 2 seconds`
- Success Criteria: Added "Dashboard initial load completes in under 2 seconds for 95th percentile"

## Edge Cases

### No Spec File Found

**Scenario**: Prerequisites check returns empty or missing spec path

**Handling**:

1. Report: "No feature specification found"
2. Suggest: "Please create a spec first using requirements-specification skill"
3. Exit gracefully

### Spec Already Complete

**Scenario**: Coverage scan finds all categories Clear, no meaningful questions

**Handling**:

1. Report: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification"
2. Output compact coverage summary showing all Clear
3. Suggest: "Spec is ready for next phase: /phoenix.design or /phoenix.architect"

### User Terminates Early

**Scenario**: User says "done" or "stop" after 2 questions

**Handling**:

1. Stop asking questions immediately
2. Integrate any pending answers
3. Report what was completed
4. Note remaining Outstanding categories
5. Suggest running review again later if needed

### Maximum Questions Reached

**Scenario**: 5 questions asked but high-impact categories still unresolved

**Handling**:

1. Complete current session
2. Report completion with Outstanding items explicitly flagged
3. Warning: "High-impact areas remain unclear: [list categories]"
4. Recommend: "Run another review session before proceeding to design"

### Ambiguous User Answer

**Scenario**: User provides unclear answer (e.g., "maybe A or B")

**Handling**:

1. Don't count as new question
2. Ask: "Please clarify: choose A or B"
3. Wait for unambiguous response
4. Proceed only when clear

### Conflicting Information

**Scenario**: Answer contradicts existing spec content

**Handling**:

1. Highlight the conflict to user
2. Ask: "This conflicts with [existing statement]. Should I replace it?"
3. If yes: Replace old with new, note change in clarifications
4. If no: Keep old, note user's rationale

## Error Handling

### Error: Spec File Not Readable

**Cause**: File permissions or encoding issue

**Action**:

1. Report: "Cannot read spec file at [path]"
2. Check file exists and is readable
3. Suggest: "Verify file permissions or encoding"
4. Exit with error

### Error: Invalid Markdown Structure

**Cause**: Spec has malformed markdown that breaks parsing

**Action**:

1. Report: "Spec file has invalid markdown structure"
2. Attempt to identify problematic section
3. Suggest: "Fix markdown syntax and retry"
4. Proceed with best-effort parsing if critical sections readable

### Error: Git Commit Fails

**Cause**: Git error when committing changes

**Action**:

1. Ensure changes are saved to file (priority)
2. Report: "Spec updated but commit failed: [error]"
3. Show git error message
4. Suggest: "Manually commit with: git add [spec] && git commit"
5. Continue with completion report

### Error: Integration Conflict

**Cause**: Can't determine where to integrate answer in spec

**Action**:

1. Save answer in Clarifications section only
2. Report: "Answer recorded in Clarifications but couldn't auto-integrate"
3. Note: "Manual integration needed in [section name]"
4. Continue with next question

## Guidelines

1. **Ask questions sequentially** - Never present multiple questions at once
2. **Always recommend an answer** - Help users make informed decisions
3. **Integrate immediately** - Update spec after each answer, don't batch
4. **Validate continuously** - Check consistency after each integration
5. **Preserve user content** - Don't rewrite unrelated sections
6. **Be explicit** - Make all clarifications concrete and testable
7. **Respect limits** - Stop at 5 questions even if more gaps exist
8. **Commit with 'docs:' prefix** - Follow git commit conventions
9. **Report thoroughly** - Provide complete coverage summary at end
10. **Guide next steps** - Always suggest what to do next
